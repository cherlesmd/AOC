My attempts at completing all the problems starting 2023 for Advent of Code.

This is only 25 days so there is an end in sight which is nice to have unlike leetcode-ing until I get an interview.

New to this so it will be done in Python, and each problem will proabably take a good 2 hours of research to complete.

Feel free to dunk on my solutions.
